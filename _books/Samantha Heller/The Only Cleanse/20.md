*Bacterial translocation*

The gut wall is a multilayered organ. It's not only a tunnel through which food and fluids pass, are digested, and absorbed, but it also keeps tight control over what gets in and out of the wall itself. The gut wall profiles bacteria, viruses, toxins, and other substances and carefully decides which ones can and cannot cross the border into the body. When tiny amounts of bacteria, toxins, or other substances cross though the wall of the intestine and travel throughout the body, it is called bacterial translocation. You might think that letting these unwanted visitors into your body would be a disaster. Yet it isn't. These interlopers trigger the body's defense system, and by doing so they help to strengthen it. Problems arise when the gut wall, known as the epithelial mucosa, is weakened and becomes flimsy, holey, or easily penetrated. This can be the result of poor diet, overuse of antibiotics, infection, or a dramatic shift in microbial composition. If this happens, a flood of unwanted endotoxins, bacteria, and viruses can escape the gut by breaching the wall and invading the body. The unwelcome pathogens can overwhelms the system, resulting in metabolic chaos, disease, and even organ failure.
