*Probiotics*

Probiotics are very different from prebiotics. While prebiotics refers to the fiber in foods that we eat and that subsequently feed our microbial companions, probiotics are actually bateria or yeasts that we ingest. Probiotics mingle with gut microbes, boosting health in many ways such as acting as powerful anti-inflammatory agents and pumping up immunity. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization define probiotics as "live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host."
These live bacteria and yeasts are found in fermented foods like yogurt and tempeh, sold as supplements, and added to foods including chocolate, juices and granola bars. The three most extensively studied probiotics are Lectobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which are live bacteria, ad Sacchromyces, which is derived from yeast. Each of these probiotics has family members, called strains. Different strains or combinations of strains have different effects on different illnesses.
