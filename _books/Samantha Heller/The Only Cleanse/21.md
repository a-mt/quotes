*Prebiotics*

One reason that fiber offers a feast of benefits it that it is the ambrosia that feeds microbiota in our GIT, especially bifidobacteria and lactobacili, two species of gut-friendly bacteria. The kinds of fiber that feed our friendly microbes are called "prebiotics".
Plant fibers are forms of carbohydrates, but because of their structure they resist digestion in the human GIT. When fiber gets to the colon the bacteria happily nosh on it. This is known as fermentation. The process of fermentation is what produces compounds that bolster immunity and reduce inflammation. Eating more prebiotics by eating more plants helps support a vigorous and diverse gut community.
