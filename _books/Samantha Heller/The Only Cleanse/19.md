*Bacteria population and fat*

Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes compose the largest population microbiota in the gut, and a healthy gut has a nice balance of the two. What scientists have found is that obese people's balance of these microbes is thrown off. They have fewer Bacteroidetes and more Firmicutes than lean people. Moreover, the proportion of Bacteroidetes increases with weight loss.
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes help digest plant fiber and produce important compounds such as butyrate, which has anti-cancer properties. They regulate bile acid metabolism and dexotify mutagenic (cancer-causing) compounds.
