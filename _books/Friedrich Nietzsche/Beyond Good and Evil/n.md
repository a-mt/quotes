Nietzsche asks: “Is greatness possible, nowadays?” Modern society is “a general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged, against the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher responsibility.” The modern person seeks a life free from fear or pain, which is a sad dereliction of their potential. Instead, we should be throwing ourselves into life at whatever risk and without getting permission from anyone. He called Christianity a “slave morality” because it emphasized “the sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit” and made the believer into a self-deriding shadow of what they could be.
