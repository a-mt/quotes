Don’t think that the bullies and manipulators are the real winners. They are psychologically sick, they will perish, eventually. What goes around, comes around ! Anyone moving against Nature, its laws, its energy will lose, one day or the other, no doubt whatsoever. It is only a matter of time.

Getting bullied, exploited and abused cannot be considered as the result of a weak personality. The so called ‘sensitive’, ‘weak’ personality is the result of manipulation, fine tuning and cunningness. Negativity results from encounters with negative people.
