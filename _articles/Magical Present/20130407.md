Direct your attention to the work at hand and let the creativity flow and energize you. If you are as hard as a rock, totally focused on what is more important and concentrated on the larger picture then nothing, not even the dirtiest personal attack can in any way affect you badly. Nature will defend you in ways we cannot comprehend. Universal forces will somehow protect you and punish the accuser(s). Moreover don’t lose your faith in humanity. There will be many who will be of help during difficult times.

Always keep these in mind – If there is a will, there is a way… There are solutions to each and every problem in life.
