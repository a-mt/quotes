One of the best ways to live in the moment is to meditate. You can also stop to calmly ask God to guide you in living more in the now and to experience the world through the wondrous eyes of a child. After all, children are not hung up on the events of the past. That’s why they’re generally so happy and carefree. They live in the now. They’re eager for new experiences and are full of life.

You can return to this enthusiastic state by being open and curious in every moment while letting go of any urges to linger in the past.
